# Dogsitter

This is the first project that I built on my own. I was motivated by finishing a css course at the Alura platform. 

Later I added some new functionalities, for example, a request to a file hosted at Heroku to populate the table on the contact page. On this page, I have written a little JavaScript to manipulate the data from the request and from the form.
